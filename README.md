## Problem
1. As someone who has moved around a lot it is hard to establish a new group of friends who play the same sports as you in a new city/country. You don't have the network of friends to call upon for different sports that you may play, tennis squash football, you don't want to commit to joining a club and having the 3 times a week commitment training/matches but just want to casually play every so often.

2. I also don't always move with my sport equipment as I don't know how long I will be living in this city.

## Solution
Creating a dashboard for people to meet people in their area who want to play sport with them.

Secondary dashboard for selling and renting sports equipment.
eg I have a surf board in my garage or an old tennis racquet that someone could borrow and I make money off it.
